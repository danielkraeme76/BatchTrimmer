# BatchTrimmer
BatchTrimmer trims silence at file edges (configurable dBFS), normalizes audio to a target peak (e.g., â€“1 dBFS), and adds fade-in/out effects with adjustable duration. It exports to WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG, or AAC with options for bit depth, sample rate, output folder, filename suffix, and overwrite mode.
